## Overview

[D3 Starter Kit](http://dankemper.net/d3-starter-kit) is a starter site for D3 projects, with plenty of documentation and examples for those just getting started with D3.js. This starter kit is based off of the Material Design Lite [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit) from Google.  

## Getting Started

Please see the [QuickStart](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit#quickstart) section of the [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit).  You will build the D3 starter kit the same way you build the WSK.
